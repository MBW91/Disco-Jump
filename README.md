# Disco Jump
My first mobile game for Android and Windows Phone is a game inspired by the classical game Q*Bert.
You jump from block to block to get them in the right color and to avoid enemies.
After every finished level you will get coins in the amount of the level number.
With these coins you are able to unlock new characters for more groovy feeling.
Also there are highscores, to challenge yourself to get the highest score.
